Using the Python editor automatically tells us the styling guide so other Python developers will know we are using Python conventions

Structure tab on the left side breaks up the Python file into variables and functions for easy access if the python file is too large
- can use refactor to rename the function and the function calls throughout the python file

In file, local history, we can use show history to see all the changes to the code in the past few hours, so we can revert or edit the code
to its previous state

Intellij and PyCharm have spell-check that is useful for variables and dictionary calls

#TODO are easier to track in a professional IDE
