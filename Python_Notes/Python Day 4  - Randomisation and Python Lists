modules are code that have been split up to make it easier for coders to use and work on

an example of a module is the random module which we can import from python libraries

we can create our own modules by creating another python file, assigning a variable in the file and import the new file
then using an attribute from the file

ex. new_module
name = Phil

import new_module
print(new_module.name) # phil

When working with list, one of the most common errors is list index out of range indexError
the index has to be in the range of the length of the list minus 1 since lists are 0 indexed
