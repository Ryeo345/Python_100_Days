"""
Global Scope is outside of a function

variables work inside a function and outside a function

Local Scope is inside of a function

variable declared inside of a function only works within the function

python does not have block scope

variable defined with a value in an if statement will effect the variable in a function,

if the code is not enclosed, the variable will have global scope
