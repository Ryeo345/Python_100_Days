OOP is modular and better than procedural programming which gets more confusing as we write more code

OOP modes after real things in the world

classes are blueprints that can create many objects of the same kind

class Waiter:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

object = Class()
the parentheses activates the constructor of the function
henry = Waiter()
Emily = Waiter()

attributes can be retrieved from the object

functions that are tied to an object are called methods
