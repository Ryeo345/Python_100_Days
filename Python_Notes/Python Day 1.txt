Python Day 1 - Data Types

print("") in python is equal to console.log("") in javaScript

\n creates a new line to reduce the amount of print keywords used

if there is a indent on a print - there will be a indentationError: unexpected indent

input() function pauses the code until the user enters an input

ex. input("A prompt for the user") to input the data we want

# in Python is equal to // in javaScript

print("Hello " + input("What is your name?"))

len() - function to get the length of the string

str is a keyword in python so we can't name it str

exercise to print the length of a name

print(len(input("What is your name? ")))


you can assign a variable to the input entered from the user

name = input("what is your name?")

the variables are changed from top to bottom similar to javascript

In Python we use snake_case and in javaScript we use camelCase

incorrect name of variable we get a name error

Data Types
integers - int: 1 2 3
floating point - float 4.6 100.0
strings - str

Data Structures
lists - list  - similar to arrays in javascript
dictionaries - dict (unordered key:value pairs) similar to objects in javascript
tuples - tup - ordered immutable sequence of objects that are enclosed by () - similar to arrays in javascript but arrays are mutable
sets - set - unordered collection of unique objects: {"a", "b"} - similar to the set object in javascript that has unique values
booleans - bool - logical value of true or false
