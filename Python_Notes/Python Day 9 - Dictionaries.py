"""
Dictionaries have two parts
1. the key is equivalent to the word in a real dictionary
2. the value is equivalent to the definition in a real dictionary

dictionary values are identified by their keys, instead of indexes in a list

dictionary[key] = value

adding new elements to the dictionary
dictionary[new_key] = new_value

create empty dictionary = {}

wipe existing dictionary = {}

example of use, restart a game and clear all stats of the user

edit value of dictionary
dictionary[key] = new_value_2

loop through a dictionary

for thing in dictionary:
    print(thing)

this will print all the keys, not the values

for key in dictionary:
    print(key)
