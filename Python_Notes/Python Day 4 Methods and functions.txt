Python Day 4 Methods and functions

ex. append(), pop(), insert(), help()

functions in python need the def keyword, correct indentation and proper structure

def keyword is used to initiate the function

class calls use camelClass while functions use snake_case

def name_of_function():
	'''
		Docstring explains function (multiple lines of comments)
	'''
	print("hello')

name_of_function() # calls the function

return keyword allows us to save the result of the function to a variable

use the print methods in the functions to debug/ see whats going on internally in the function
